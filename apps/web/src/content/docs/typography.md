### Create a new monorepo project

To create a new monorepo project, run the `init` command. You will be prompted
to select the type of project you are creating.

```bash
npx shadcn@canary init
```

Select the `Next.js (Monorepo)` option.

```bash
? Would you like to start a new project?
    Next.js
❯   Next.js (Monorepo)
```

This will create a new monorepo project with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`,
and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the build system.

Everything is set up for you, so you can start adding components to your project.

Note: The monorepo uses React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Add components to your project

To add components to your project, run the `add` command **in the path of your app**.

```bash
cd apps/web
```

```bash
npx shadcn@canary add [COMPONENT]
```

The CLI will figure out what type of component you are adding and install the
correct files to the correct path.

For example, if you run `npx shadcn@canary add button`, the CLI will install the button component under `packages/ui` and update the import path for components in `apps/web`.

If you run `npx shadcn@canary add login-01`, the CLI will install the `button`, `label`, `input` and `card` components under `packages/ui` and the `login-form` component under `apps/web/components`.
